Designed using clean architecture principles
Implements full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations
Follows RESTful conventions and best practices
Modular and testable codebase
Easy to scale and maintain

ðŸ“Œ Tech Stack: Node.js | Express | MongoDB | Mongoose | JWT Authentication | Postman for API Testing
